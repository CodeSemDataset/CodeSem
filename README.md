# CodeSem

CodeSem is a dataset of programs extracted from real-world flagship software codebases (e.g., Linux Kernel,

GCC, MySQL, etc.) and manually validated for equivalence prediction and alias prediction. In this repository, we include not only the CodeSem dataset, but also the re-implementation of the CuBERT, GGNN, and Graph Sandwiches models, as well as scripts for converting program source code into corresponding model inputs.

Next we'll cover the contents of each subdirectory.

## datasets

## models
The models we used in the evaluation, namely [CuBERT](https://github.com/CodeSemDataset/CodeSem/tree/main/models/CuBERT), [GGNN](https://github.com/CodeSemDataset/CodeSem/tree/main/models/GGNN), and [Graph Sandwiches](https://github.com/CodeSemDataset/CodeSem/tree/main/models/GraphSandwiches).

Please refer to [this document](https://github.com/CodeSemDataset/CodeSem/blob/main/models/CuBERT/README.md) for the use of CuBERT. For the use of graph models, please refer to README in the specific task subdirectory. For example, for the equivalence prediction task of GGNN, please refer to this [README](https://github.com/CodeSemDataset/CodeSem/blob/main/models/GGNN/ggnn_for_equivalent/README.md).

## scripts
The scripts we used to convert source code to model input.

Code in [scripts/tokens](https://github.com/CodeSemDataset/CodeSem/tree/main/scripts/tokens) is for CuBERT and code in [scripts/graph](https://github.com/CodeSemDataset/CodeSem/tree/main/scripts/graph) is for graph models.
